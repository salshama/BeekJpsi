Research work done for the UVic ATLAS group.

<br><br>The files in this respository are part of my research assistantship of event selection optimization of B-meson decays to electrons in the ATLAS Detector at the LHC.

<br><br>The decay studied is for a B-meson decaying via a W-boson into a K* and two electrons. The resonant (J/Œ® decays on-shell into an electron and a positron) and non-resonant (electrons that come from the 3 GeV J/ùúì have no particular invariant mass) cases were studied.
